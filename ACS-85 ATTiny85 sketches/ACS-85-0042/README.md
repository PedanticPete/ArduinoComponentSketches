# ACS-85-0042

Square wave VCO with Chiptune sounds


## Overview

Uses a 16 bit counter in a DDS fashion like. http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN

This is a vco with 2 outputs.  One is the plain sqaurewave and the other is the same
frequency, but with lots of arping and effects to sound like a chiptune synth of some kind.

There are lots of algorithms and room to create some of your own.

Originally, I had ACS-85-0040, but it was a bit busy. Made this just the Chiptune version of that sketch.
