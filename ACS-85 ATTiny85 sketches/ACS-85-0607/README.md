# ACS-85-0607
4 Channel drum patterns with randomness
==============

## Overview:

Three drum triggers selected with tempo and a randomness for flipping bits.

Similar to ACS-85-0603, and ACS-85-0604. however, there are no patterns and the randomness is set in the code.
Just a tempo.

Three outputs are set as triggers, but the width of the trigger can be modified in the code.



## Pinout:
 

 
## Improvements:
A Sync would be nice, but there are only so many pins to work with.  Consider driving this with a clk rather than an analog pot/tempo if thats what you need
