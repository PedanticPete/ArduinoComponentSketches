# ACS-85-0604
3 Channel drum patterns with randomness
==============

## Overview:

Three drum triggers selected with tempo and a randomness for flipping bits.

Similar to ACS-85-0603, however, there are no patterns.
Just a tempo and randomness.

Three outputs are set as triggers, but the width of the trigger can be modified in the code.

 



## Pinout:
 

 
## Improvements:
A Sync would be nice, but there are only so many pins to work with.  Consider driving this with a clk rather than an analog pot/tempo if thats what you need
