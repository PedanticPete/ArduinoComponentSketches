# ACS-85-0041

Square wave VCO with PWM  


## Overview

Uses a 16 bit counter in a DDS fashion like. http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN

This is a vco with outputs.  One is the mainsqaurewave and the other is the same
frequency, but adjustable width.

Originally, I had ACS-85-0040, but it was a bit busy. Made this just the PWM version of that sketch.
