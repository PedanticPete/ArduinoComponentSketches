# ACS-85-0040

Square wave VCO with PWM and Chiptune sound


## Overview

Uses a 16 counter in a DDS fashion like. http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN

This is a vco with outputs.  One is the mainsqaurewave and the other is the same
frequency, but adjustable width.

There is a mode that makes a chiptune sound too.

This is really a bit of a hot mess but I put it into my project anyways.
See ACS-85-0041 and ACS-85-0042 where it was split into two sketches.
