# ACS-85-0040

Square wave VCO with PWM and Chiptune sound


## Overview

Uses a 16 counter in a DDS fashion like. http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN

This is a vco with outputs.  One is the mainsqaurewave and the other is the same
frequency, but adjustable width.

There is a mode that makes a chiptune sound too.  Its a lot of stuff on one chip, but the mixing of the arp sounds with the pwm channel is a bit much.

This is really a bit of a hot mess but I put it into my project anyways.
See ![ACS-85-0041](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/blob/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0041)  and ![ACS-85-0042](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/blob/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0042) where the pwm and chip sounds were split into their respective sketches.
