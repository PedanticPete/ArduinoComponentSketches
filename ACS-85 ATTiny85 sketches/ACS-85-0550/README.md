# ACS-85-0550

Melody Maker Upper 1

## Overview

One control for speed
one bool for Bananas - just kinda freq climbs

Notes are played on three pins with each pin updating in a round robin fashion.

AND/OR/XOR them or or just sum them using resistors

## Pinout

## Examples

This is a sample of all 3 pins summed up and playing at the same time.

you could easily send each pin to its own destination or whatever.

## Improvement ideas

There is a pin left.  Either as a mode input or and output (xor ?)

perhaps put all the code together (0550, 0551 and 0552) into a single sketch for ATTINY84
