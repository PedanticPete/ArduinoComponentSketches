# ACS-85-0030

 ATTiny85 4 Channel PWM LFO  (with silence)

## Overview

One inputs:

- Speed
- Duty cycle

Four Outputs:

 - LFO as PWM(4)
  Maybe an LFO is not quite the explaination here. It has a triangle ramp, with a random period for each ramp, but also a random pause between each ramp.  Consider using with LDRs to fade in and out ambient sounds.
