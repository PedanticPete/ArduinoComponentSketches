 ATTiny85 Simple VCA

## Overview

Simple VCA that really only works on a squarewave.
Works in the same manner as the simple lunetta VCA.  Rather than adjusting the amplitude of an input single, we are "chopping" the value of the amplitude.

See a good example of this on [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2015/04/10/logic-noise-more-cmos-cowbell/)

Two inputs:

- Square wave input
- Analog volume

One Output:

 - PWM output
