# ArduinoComponentSketches
Collection of sketches for ATTiny to replace logic blocks. These can be used in lunetta like circuits.

[Arduino Component Sketches](http://robstave.github.io/acs/)
 

## Objective

Create a library of Arduino sketches that can be loaded on ATTiny AVR micro controllers to use in lo-fi synth/noise circuits.   Either by replacing a block of logic or creating a new type of circuit block altogether.  The intent is not to create a synth on a chip, but rather to have a series of building blocks to create richer devices with an actual lower device count.  Rather than write the code to tailor the circuit, these are a prewritten library of sketches that can be used to plug into your breadboard or whatever.  Kinda like if you discovered a whole new series of CMOS chips like the 4000 series.

Of course, these are really 8-bit microcontroller chips with limitations such as speed, quantization and code quirks.  

I am focusing on ATTiny85, 84 and 2313 for the most part.  Again, these are components, not full blown synth on a chip things.  But you can get a lot of sound from a minimal part count.

There are other plenty of projects out there with similar concepts. I draw inspiration from everything and hope that in some little way, someone can draw inspiration from my ramblings.

## Similar works

[MiniMoSynth](http://minimosynth.com/) A Formfactor and open source/open hardware design to make ATTiny Blocks.  Certainly the closest to what I have here.  I do not really have a
consistant strategy nor a consistant input like these little
blocks.  Check em out.

[Rad-fi System from Bleep Labs](http://bleeplabs.com/store/the-rad-fi-system/) Uses Arduinos as building blocks for Synths on a breadboard. A collection of ATTiny micros with these sketches would be completely compatible with this system.

[Bastl Kastle](http://www.bastl-instruments.com/instruments/kastle/kastle-synth/) uses 2 ATTiny85s that can be programmed with other features.

[Electric Druid](http://electricdruid.net/tap-tempo-lfo-taplfo-v2d/) has some AVRs and others as building blocks.  For example, an LFO.

## Background

## Requirements

Ability to program ATTiny chips.  This only requires an arduino uno, a breadboard and a handful of ATTiny85s to get started.

[Requirements](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/wiki/Requirements-and-Setup)

In some cases, a few extra parts might be needed like a small PWM filter or R2R ladder. These will be kept at a minimum unless the focus of the sketch IS an interface chip ( think optical encoder, Digital Pot controller and so on)

## System

I have a bit of numbering system so I can halfway keep these things straight.
